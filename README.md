# Experimenting with scikit
This repository includes some scikit machine learning classification examples. 

Here there are 4 datsets with .dat extension and 3 python files.
graph.py will help in visualizing the structuring of datapoints in the datasets as it is always better to understand before proceeding to any classification problem. 

KNN.py and Bayes Classification.py are the classification code which classifies data and generates relevant analysis.

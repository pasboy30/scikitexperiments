# Experimenting with scikit
This repository includes some scikit machine learning classification examples. 

Here there are 4 datsets with .dat extension and 3 python files.
graph.py will help in visualizing the structurring of datasets. I suggest you yo do that before initiating any classifier. 
KNN.py and Bayes Classification.py are the classification code which classifies data and generates relevant analysis. 

The datasets here have two namely 1 and 2 classes and consists of two features.
